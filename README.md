# Favvychan - Counter app

## Welcome!

Thanks for checking out this project.

**This project was created with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The project

The counter app was created to ease users in taking simple counts and saving these counts as well.

In this app users can keep count of things no matter the amount by either using thr increment button or decrement button and storing these counts by using the save button.

## What I learned

This is my first project and I can say that in everything coding will be worth the while. Using the HTML was great in creating every wriiten text visible on the project, and I played around with CSS to create a suitable and pleasing design for this project as well, but most importantly, I was able to use a bit of JavaScript to help make the increament, decrement, and save button functional.
